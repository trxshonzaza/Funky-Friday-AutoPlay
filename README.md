# NOTE: FAR_LEFT is the note farthest to the left. LEFT is the note closest to the left. FAR_RIGHT is the note farthest to the right.  RIGHT is the note closest to the right.

When you launch the application, it will tell you to input your RGB values for your notes. You can find these in your arrow settings in Funky Friday.

After you input these values, you must input your funky friday keybinds.

After these are completed, If Roblox is detected, Roblox will automatically maximize. AutoPlay will run automatically once notes are detected.
